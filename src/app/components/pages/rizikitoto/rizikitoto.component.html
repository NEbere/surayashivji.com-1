          <p>Rizikitoto is the non-profit organization that I founded and ran from 2014 to 2017. Rizikitoto utilizes
            mobile app revenue to fund initiatives that promote self-sustenance in East African orphanages.</p>

        <div class="mainparagraph">
          <p>On trips to visit my parentsâ€™ hometowns in East Africa, my siblings and I would volunteer at Bright
            Futures orphanage in Kampala, Uganda. We taught kids aged 6 to 17 reading, writing, and math skills and
            learned about their personal interests and goals too. While spending time with the kids at Bright Futures,
            I learned that their problems were not limited to need, but also self-sustenance. These children were
            already incredibly bright, but they lacked the resources and guidance to pursue their dreams. After all,
            how can a girl with no books for school someday become a teacher?</p>
