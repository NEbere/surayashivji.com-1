          <p>Ever wonder what Harry, Ron, and Hermione post on social media? Me too! Potter Pics was an experiment that allowed
            me to explore two of my favorite worlds: Harry Potter and iOS. Simply enter the app with The Unlocking Charm
            to be sorted into a house and start interacting with the rest of the magical world.</p>

        <div class="mainparagraph">
          <p>There are countless aspects of the Harry Potter world that could translate to engaging, digital experiences. Because
            I created this app for fun, there were few feature constraints that I had to work around. As such, I juggled
            multiple ideas throughout my design process. I experimented with a sorting house quiz for the user’s onboarding,
            having an interactive map similar to Marauder’s Map for users to see their friends’ locations, using spells to
            unlock features, and more.</p>
          <p>I ultimately decided to integrate three subtle, visual Harry Potter references.</p>

        <h6 class="submaintitle">House Based Navigation</h6>
        <div class="mainparagraph">
          <p>The user’s navigation and secondary font’s color changes based on his/her Hogwarts house. This allows the user
            to have a more personalized experience while not getting distracting from the core functionality.</p>
        </div>
        <h6 class="submaintitle">Home Intro</h6>
        <div class="mainparagraph">
          <p>The home page resembles the Harry Potter movie introductions. The music, moving clouds, and iconic text provide
            a familiar feel for the user as he/she enters the app. The user taps “Alohamora,” also known as The Unlocking
            Charm, to login or sign up. It makes sense to have obvious, familiar Harry Potter elements for the onboarding
            so that the user is immediately engaged. I animated the clouds in After Effects and created the text in Photoshop.</p>

        <h6 class="submaintitle">Icons</h6>
        <div class="mainparagraph">
          <p>The icons used are well-known aspects from the Harry Potter world.</p>
