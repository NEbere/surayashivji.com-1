          <p>Ever wonder what Harry, Ron, and Hermione post on social media? Me too! Potter Pics was an experiment that allowed
            me to explore two of my favorite worlds: Harry Potter and iOS. Simply enter the app with The Unlocking Charm
            to be sorted into a house and start interacting with the rest of the magical world.</p>

          <p>There are countless aspects of the Harry Potter world that could translate to engaging, digital experiences. Because
            I created this app for fun, there were few feature constraints that I had to work around. As such, I juggled
            multiple ideas throughout my design process. I experimented with a sorting house quiz for the user’s onboarding,
            having an interactive map similar to Marauder’s Map for users to see their friends’ locations, using spells to
            unlock features, and more.</p>
          <p>I ultimately decided to integrate three subtle, visual Harry Potter references.</p>
