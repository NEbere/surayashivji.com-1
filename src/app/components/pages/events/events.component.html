          <p>Group messaging. You have the freedom to communicate what you want, when you want, and to multiple people
            at once. Group messages, however, are an archive of thoughts and are not optimized for finding a mutual
            time to get together. Alternate scheduling services such as WhenIsGood or Doodle are used for meetings and
            interviews but feel out of place in a social context.</p>

          <p>I began by conducting secondary research on the usage of mobile group messaging, the ecosystem of
            messaging apps, and the demographic clusters within these apps. Pew Research Center reported
            that 42% of smartphone owners ages 18 to 29 uses messaging apps such as WhatsApp, iMessage, Kik or
            Messenger. As such, I chose to focus on people aged 15 to 30 as the demographic for this project. This
            chart displays users of any age who use a messaging app via mobile phone at least once per month.</p>

                <p>The user research insights showed that people love using group messages to chat, but find them

                  to
                  plan events in due to their back and forth nature. At the same time, creating events should feel
                  casual,
                  simple, and easy. For these reasons, I decided that using an iMessage extension would be the best

                  opposed to a stand-alone, external app. An iMessage app feels casual, convenient, and requires less

          <p>The user interviews validated my assumption that existing scheduling apps feel out of context in a
            casual setting; more importantly, they suggested that the process for a user to actually fill out his/her
            availability is what is currently most tedious. So, the first challenge was creating a simple, minimal
            input interaction for the user to enter his/her availability.

              <p>I explored input interactions such as automated suggestions, manual suggestions, as well as grid-based
                date and time selections. I ultimately decided to use a 'painting' touch gesture so that users can
                easily paint their availability on the calendar. Though it is sometimes necessary to create custom
                controls, using a pre-established interaction is favorable in this case as the unique value in this app
                does not lie in the calendar by itself.</p>

          <p>Creating an app that lives within the context of a Messages conversation introduces unique design
            constraints. I had to work around the lack of screen real estate and use Apple’s HIG to think about the
            existing visual elements that users expect to see within iMessage. In order to balance visual appeal and
            usability, I decided to have the person initiating the event select a time frame from which the rest of
            the group can respond to as opposed to displaying all possible hours. This tradeoff sacrifices the
            flexibility that other scheduling services provide but makes sense for the light-weight, casual events
            that this app is designed to create.</p>

            <li><b>Respect the platform that you're designing for.</b> It's important to understand the user's
              expectations and use established interaction patterns in order to design an experience that can live
              within the context of a Messages conversation.</li>
            <li><b>Provide focused content.</b> Messaging extensions should have a single focus. For example, there are
              countless potential integrations for an events app such as music playlists, payment services, social
              media, reminders, etc. However, for clarity and ease of use, such integrations should either be optional,
              limited, or eliminated all together. This is an area of the app I could definitely improve upon through
              additional user research.</li>
